# Breast-Cancer-Classification

The aim is to build a predictive model and classify the type of tumor (i.e. Malignant(Cancerous) or Benign(Non-Cancerous)) the patient might have.

A perfect project to learn Data Analytics and apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XG Boost) to predict ttpe of the tumor.


# Dataset Description 
The dataset is based on diagnosis done using fine needle aspiration. Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure in which a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during fine needle aspiration can help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer.

# Dataset Details 
The data has 569 rows of 31 variables.
